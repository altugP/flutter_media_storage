### Installation

#### Option 1: Depending on it

You can load this package as dependency by adding this git repository to your
existing `pubspec.yaml` as:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_media_storage:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/altugP/flutter_media_storage.git
```

After adding the git dependency you install it by running `flutter pug get` as
you would any "normal"/published package. Then you can import the library in
Dart code using:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_media_storage/flutter_media_storage.dart';
```

#### Option 2: Copy-Paste the required file

This library was created as a single file library, meaning you can just copy
the `flutter_media_storage.dart` file from the `src` directory, paste it into
your code base at your desired destination and use it as if you coded this
yourself.

<h2 id="how-it-works">üîç How it works</h2>

Brief overview of the classes:

- **MediaData**: A serializable object that represents one downloaded media entity. This is mainly metadata. The stored information includes: original url, filename on disc, file type (video, image, unspecified) and date of last update.
- **MediaFileStorage**: A class that handles IO operations to (de-)serialize `MediaData` objects as well as the media files themself as byte files. This class is used to download media, create the metadata objects and handle all of them.
- **LoadedMediaStorage**: A class that handles (de-)serializing a list of `MediaData` objects. Each downloaded medium triggers the creation of a `MediaData` object. If such an object exists for a url then a file containing the content of that url is present on the device and the object points to that file. `LoadedMediaStorage` is used to persist a list of all `MediaData` objects
and allow searching for urls in that list.
- **MediaStorage**: The main class to use as a user. It contains private instances of the aforementioned classes and calls the required functions as needed. It exposes two `get` functions that take in a url and optionally a filename if the user wants to specify where to save the contents of the url.

Each media (either a video or an image) is adressed by its original url. The
user calls `getDataAsFile()` or `getDataAsBinary()` and provides a url. Then
a search is triggered. If the url is found in one of the stored `MediaData`
objects then the file with the contents of the url is already stored on the
device. If the user has not set the `isUpdate` flag in the functions then that
file is returned as either a file or a list of bytes. Otherwise it is treated
as if the file didn't exist. An HTTP GET request is performed to the url and
the responses body is interpreted as bytes and stored in a file. The file will
either be named after the current date (.dat) or be named after the optional
file name the user has provided in the two functions. Then a `MediaData` object
of this url is created and stored into the list. IO calls to persist the
changes are triggered. After they have completed the required file is returned.
If something goes wrong null will be returned.
